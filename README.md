# üêç PythonJourney
To capture my journey of learning Python.

## ü§î Why start the journeyÔºü
I've always wanted to learn a computer language. Python is the perfect place to start. Why? Because I'm brainwashed.üòÇ

## üöÄ How the journey will goÔºü

I asked ChatGPT/Claude to create a 3-month roadmap on learning Python for me. And break it down into weeks. 

During this learning process, I will consult the opinions of artificial intelligence and adjusted my own learning strategies based on their suggestions. 

I will try to remember the Python knowledge learned as much as possible and applied it to practice. This repository serves as my learning journal.



### Month 1:

*Week 1:*

- Install Python and VS Code (or editor of your choice)
- Learn about datatypes (strings, numbers, booleans), variables
- Practice with simple operators and conditional logic (if/else)

*Week 2:*

- Study loops (for, while) and iterate over lists/strings
- Learn about functions; practice writing a few simple functions
- Build a basic calculator or password generator script

*Week 3:*

- Learn about objects and classes; understand attributes and methods
- Practice OOP by building a basic model of something simple (like a vehicle)
- Learn Boolean logic and control flows; build a virtual assistant

*Week 4:*

- Review topics from Week 1-3; ask questions about any concepts you're unsure of
- Build another beginner Python script (like monthly payment calculator)

### Month 2: 

*Week 1-2:*

- Learn about lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries (data structures) 
- Study examples that iterate, access, and manipulate these data structures
- Build a basic app that uses data structures (e.g. a phone book contact app)

*Week 3:*

- Learn about handling user input and output; practice with a script 
- Learn about exceptions and exception handling; add to your user input script

*Week 4:*

- Review OOP and classes; practice by adding some attributes/methods to a class
- Learn about file handling and processing; build a script that manipulates a CSV file

### Month 3: 

*Week 1-2:*

- Learn about libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.
- Practice importing and using libraries by building a simple data analysis script

*Week 3:*

- Keep practicing with scripts and simple classes; revise any previous topics
- Consider learning a Python web framework like Flask; build a tiny web app 

*Week 4:*

- Review fundamentals and projects you've built; reflect on your progress 
- Explore next steps: more advanced Python topics, other frameworks/libraries, etc.
- Practice Python consistently even after this roadmap ends! Continuous learning is key.



*Based on my availability and learning needs, I will make appropriate adjustments to the roadmap.
