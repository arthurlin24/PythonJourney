# üêç PythonJourney
To capture my journey of learning Python.

## ü§î Why start the journeyÔºü
I've always wanted to learn a computer language.

## üöÄ How the journey will goÔºü

I ask Claude to create a roadmap to learn Python.

Here's a suggested 3-month roadmap to learn Python from scratch:

Month 1:

1. Install Python and set up the environment. Install Python 3 and an editor like Visual Studio Code.
2. Learn Python basics. Cover data types, variables, conditional logic, loops, functions, objects, etc. You can learn from Python's official tutorial and reference manuals.
3. Practice with simple scripts and applications. Some examples:
- A script to calculate monthly payments
- A script to generate random passwords
- A basic GUI app using Tkinter
4. Learn Python libraries. Introduction to some common libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc. Do some practice projects using these libraries.

Month 2:

1. Deep dive into Python OOP concepts. Learn about classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, etc. Build some simple classes and applications.
2. Learn unit testing and debugging. Use libraries like Pytest and Python debugging tool to improve your code.
3. Learn Python web frameworks. Introduction to Django and Flask. Build some small web applications.
4. Practice with data structures and algorithms. Implement searching, sorting, linked lists, trees, etc. in Python.
5. Learn database basics. Use MySQL and SQLAlchemy to build simple database-backed applications.

Month 3:

1. Build a web API using Flask or Django REST Framework. Create an API and front-end to access some dataset or information.
2. Learn advanced Python topics. Asynchronous programming with AsyncIO, concurrency and parallelism, regular expressions, metaprogramming, etc.
3. Create a bigger project to practice all the skills. For example, a web scraper project, a desktop GUI application, or building a game.
4. Join the Python community. Follow popular Python blogs, podcasts, and startup communities. Start contributing to open source projects.
5. Review and solidify your learning. Go back to the topics you're still weak in and review again. Take online courses/certifications to strengthen your understanding.

With persistence and consistency, you can learn Python from a beginner level to an intermediate level in 3 months using this roadmap. Feel free to adjust the pace and topics based on your needs. Let me know if you have any other questions!

Here's a suggested weekly plan for learning Python over 3 months:

Month 1

Week 1:

- Install Python and VS Code
- Learn data types, variables, conditional logic, loops
- Practice with simple scripts like monthly payment calculator  

Week 2:

- Learn functions, objects and Python classes
- Practice by building a basic GUI app with Tkinter
- Learn about NumPy and Matplotlib
- Project: Random password generator

Week 3:

- Dig into Python OOP, inheritance and encapsulation
- Learn unit testing with Pytest; practice debugging 
- Project: A class to represent a bank account 

Week 4:

- Introduction to Django and Flask
- Build a small web application with one of the frameworks

Month 2


Week 5:

- Practice with linked lists, trees and other data structures
- Implement sorting and searching algorithms in Python

Week 6:

- Learn MySQL and SQLAlchemy
- Build a database-backed application

Week 7:

- Create a web API using Flask or Django REST Framework
- Build front-end to access data from API

Week 8: 

- Learn asynchronous programming with AsyncIO 
- Study concurrency, parallelism and regular expressions

Month 3

Week 9-12:

- Work on a bigger Python project, e.g. web scraper, desktop app or game
- Join the Python community; contribute to open source
- Review and solidify learning; take Python course/certification (optional)

This is just a suggested weekly plan, feel free to adjust the pace based on your availability and learning needs. The key is to start working on concrete Python projects as much as possible to put what you learn into practice. Let me know if you have any other questions! I'm happy to provide more suggestions and resources for learning Python.
