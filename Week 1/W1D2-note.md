## Learning Plan for today

Day 2: 

- Study numeric datatypes (int, float, complex); use operators (`+, -, *, /, **, %`)
- Learn about type conversion between strings/numbers; practice in VS Code

## Summary

### Datatypes in Python

In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

- Text Type:	str
- Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
- Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
- Mapping Type:	dict
- Set Types:	set, frozenset
- Boolean Type:	bool
- Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
- None Type:	NoneType

Day 1 we learned something about string, and today I am gonna study numeric datatypes.

There are three numeric types in Python:

- int

Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.

- float

Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

- complex

Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part.
