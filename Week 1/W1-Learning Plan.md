I asked Claude to create a specific study plan for each day based on the first week's learning path. The following is its response:

Day 1: 

- Install Python and VS Code (a free, popular editor)
- Learn about strings (syntax, methods) and basic operators (`+, *, %`)
- Practice with f-strings and string methods in VS Code; print some strings!

Day 2: 

- Study numeric datatypes (int, float, complex); use operators (`+, -, *, /, **, %`)
- Learn about type conversion between strings/numbers; practice in VS Code

Day 3: 

- Learn about booleans (True, False) and conditional logic (if/else)
- Practice if/else in VS Code; write some simple conditional examples

Day 4:

- Learn in detail about variables; rules for naming and assigning values
- Practice using variables in VS Code to store different datatypes; print the variables!

Day 5: 

- Review strings, numbers, booleans and variables
- Put it all together by writing some simple Python scripts in VS Code using what you've learned! Some examples:

› Mad Libs game that uses variables and f-strings

› Calculate sales tax on an item based on input price

› Check if someone is 18+ years old; print a message

› Convert temperatures between Farenheit and Celsius scales

Day 6 and 7: 

- Practice with more Python examples and mini-scripts in VS Code
- Refer to any online Python basics tutorials/references if needed
- Ask questions about anything unclear before moving on to Week 2 topics
- Consider Python skill-building websites like Datacamp, EduCode, or Udacity 



Some tips for Week 1:

• Focus on truly understanding each new concept, not just copying examples

• Apply each topic by experimenting in VS Code; modify example code by yourself
• Review by re-reading notes and practicing with examples again

• Move on to a new topic only when you feel comfortable with the current one

• Have fun with it! Coding is challenging but rewarding. Practice patience and persistence.
